## Overview

### Introduction

This repository contains the full-stack code for a content writer site that supports publishing posts with images, admin management, a resume builder, and a portfolio section. The focus is on **smooth writing UX**, **robust image handling**, and **manageable admin controls**.

### Features

Users should be able to:

- View a homepage with author intro, services, and featured portfolio.
- Browse blog posts with pagination and cover images.
- Create, edit, delete posts, and access unpublished and published post (if granted admin-access only).
- Rich-text editor with inline/bubble menu, image insertion, and drafts.
- Upload images (Cloudinary) with orphan-image cleanup (triggered on delete/update/clear draft).
- Generate resumes with experience management (CRUD + client-side print/export).
- View portfolio articles and contact the author.
- Protect admin routes with authentication and role checks (NextAuth + Google).

### Blog / Post Editor (Admin)

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; justify-content: center; margin: auto; width: 100%; gap: 6px">
  <img width="200" alt="new post"
  src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hikmahx/sarah-yousuph/refs/heads/main/public/readme/new-post.gif'
  />
  <img width="200" alt="admin blog"

  <img width="200" alt="blog post"
  src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hikmahx/sarah-yousuph/refs/heads/main/public/readme/blog-post.gif'
  />
</div>

> **Note:** The post editor is part of the Admin Area (see Admin Area section). The editor uses `Tiptap` and provides a bubble/inline menu, image insertion, and drafts. Blog posts are displayed using **tailwind/typography prose** for clean formatting.

- **Post listing**
  - Paginated posts to prevent heavy initial loads.
  - Post previews include title, excerpt, author, published date, and cover image.

- **Image handling**
  - Cloudinary for image uploads and delivery.
  - Images can be deleted when a post is deleted, updated, or a draft is cleared.  

- **Editor features**
  - `Tiptap` rich-text editor with inline/bubble menu: bold, italic, links, headings, lists, code blocks, images.
  - Image insertion supports drag-and-drop upload and validated image URLs.
  - Draft storage persisted via `localStorage`.
